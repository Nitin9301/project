    <h3 >what is chopper</h3>
    <p>A chopper is a static device that converts fixed DC input voltage to a variable DC output voltage. It is
        basically a high speed ON/OFF semiconductor switch. It may be thought of as DC equivalent of an AC transformer
        since they behave in an identical manner.

        Chopper is fed through a constant DC voltage source and its output is variable DC voltage. The average value of
        output DC voltage may be less than or higher than the input DC voltage source. A simple diagram defining the
        chopper is shown below.</p>

    <h3 style="color: brown;">Working principle of chopper</h3>
    <p>
        A chopper is a high-speed ON/OFF switch. It connected the source to load and disconnects the load from the
        source at a fast speed. The following image represents the simple circuit to show its working principle.</p>
    <img src="what-is-chopper2.png" alt="error">
    <p> In this circuit, the switch SW is a chopper. This switch can be made ON and OFF at a very high speed. In this
        way, the load may be connected and disconnected from the supply source Vs.

        When the switch is ON, the load voltage is equal to the source voltage Vs, and when the switch is OFF, the load
        voltage becomes equal to ZERO.

        Thus, a chopped voltage across the load is obtained. The output voltage, i.e., the voltage across the load, is
        shown in the below image.
    </p>
    <img src="what-is-chopper3.png" alt="error">
    <p>When the switch SW is made OFF, the load current finds its path through freewheeling diode D. Therefore, diode D
        acts as a short, and hence the voltage across the load becomes zero.

        An inductor in the chopper is an essential thing. This inductor makes diode D forward biased when the switch SW
        is OFF.

        Even though the switch SW is made OFF, the load current doesn't become ZERO. Instead, it flows through the
        freewheeling diode, inductor L, and load. The load current is continuous, as shown below.</p>
    <img src="what-is-chopper4.png" alt="error">
    <p>It may be seen from the above waveform of the output current of a chopper that, during ON time, the current
        rises, whereas during OFF time, the load current io decays.

        The time for which the chopper connects load from the source is called ON time (TON). Whereas the time for which
        load is disconnected from the source is called OFF time (TOFF).</p>
    <p><strong>duty cycle</strong><br>
        A duty cycle is defined as the ratio of ON time to the total time. The symbol α denotes it. The total time is
        the sum of ON and OFF <br>

        Duty Cycle = TON / (TON+TOFF)<br>

        Assuming (TON+TOFF) = T, the duty cycle is given as below.<br>

        Duty Cycle, α = (TON / T)</p><br>
    <h3 style="color: blueviolet;">Types of chopper</h3>
    <p>here are mainly two types of chopper, Step-up and Step-down chopper. This classification is based on the average
        DC output voltage of the chopper. However, based on quadrant operation, a chopper may be classified into five
        different types: Class-A, Class-B, Class-C, Class-D, and Class-E chopper.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>step down chopper</strong></li>
        <p>A chopper whose average DC output voltage is less than the source voltage is called a step-down chopper.
            Power
            flows are always from source to load in this chopper.
            Classification based on Quadrant Operation</p>
        <li><strong>step up chopper</strong></li>
        <p>It is a kind of chopper in which the average DC output voltage is more than the source voltage. In this
            chopper,
            power flows from load to source, and load contains a source of emf and should be inductive.</p>

    </ol>
    <h3 style="color: blue;">classification of chopper based of quaderant</h3>
    <p>The chopper is a semiconductor static device, which essentially means that the direction of current flow is
        restricted through it. But chopper circuit can be so modified that the operation of the chopper is achieved in
        any of the four quadrants.

        This gives us a ground to classify the choppers. Based on quadrant operation, there are five types of choppers:
        Class-A, Class-B, Class-C, Class-D, and Class-E choppers.</p>
    <ol style="font-size: medium;">
        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">Class A Chopper</a> can only operate in the first quadrant. It means that the load current and
            load voltage are
            always positive. Load current always flows from source to load, and hence we can say that power is always
            transferred from source to load. The step-down chopper is an example of a Class-A chopper.</li><br>

        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">Class B Chopper</a> is confined in the second quadrant. It means that the chopper's output
            voltage will be
            positive, but the load current will be negative. Negative load current means io flows from load to source.
            Thus, the power will always transfer from load to source in this type of chopper. The step-up chopper is a
            Class-B chopper.</li><br>
        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">Class C Chopper</a> can operate in both the first and second quadrant. The first quadrant
            operation acts as a
            step-down chopper, while in the second quadrant, it behaves as a step-up chopper. Class-C is obtained by
            parallelly connecting Class-A & Class-B chopper. This type of chopper is also known as the Two Quadrant
            Class-A chopper.</li><br>
        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">Class D Chopper</a> can operate in the first and fourth quadrant. In this chopper, the
            direction of load current
            doesn't reverse. Instead, the average DC output voltage (Vo) may reverse. Power can either be transferred
            from source to load or load to source. This chopper is also known as the Two Quadrant Class-B chopper.</li>
        <br>
        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">Class E chopper</a> is a universal chopper and can operate in all four quadrants. Four choppers
            and four diodes
            are required to make the circuit of the Class-E chopper. The necessary condition for this chopper is that
            load must be inductive.</li><br>
